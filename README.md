  This project is a note saver built on top of an MVC framework. The application allows you to add and delete notes. Notes are stored and deleted from a database through PDO connection to a MySQL backend.

  Clone the repo to your local server window. Make sure to copy the files and into the root of your server in order for the application to run. Cloning the Github repo will produce a folder with the files inside, but, I have designed the application to run by setting the files to run at the very root of a local server.

  I have also included a copy of the database for testing purposes so it can be cloned along witht the project files. I have provided database credentials in the config.php file.
